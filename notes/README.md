# Notes and solutions

This page contains some notes I have written on topics in which I am interested, mostly mathematics and physics. It also contains my solutions to exercises in some books I used to brush up my knowledge.

## Solutions

* [Theodore Frankel, The geometry of Physics (Cambridge University Press, 1997)](geomphys.pdf). I also have some [notes](geomphysh.pdf) on some harder to follow derivations.
