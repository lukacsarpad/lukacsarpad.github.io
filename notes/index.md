# Notes and solutions

This page contains some notes I have written on topics in which I am interested, mostly mathematics and physics. It also contains my solutions to exercises in some books I used to brush up my knowledge.

## Solutions

* [Theodore Frankel, The geometry of Physics (Cambridge University Press, 1997)](geomphys.pdf). I also have some [notes](geomphysh.pdf) on some harder to follow derivations.
* [Roger J. Barlow, Statistics: A guide to the use of statistical methods in the physical sciences (Wiley, 1989)](barlow.pdf)

## Notes

* [Classical field theory](clfields.pdf): Notations, signatures, explicit expressions for conserved quantities in classical field theory.
* [Complex scalar fields](compscal.pdf): Some (very old) notes on the didactics of variational problems with complex fields.
* [Notations for Laguerre polynomials and functions](laguerre.pdf)

## Sources, etc.

For the LaTeX sources of the pdf files and supplementary material (e.g., computer algebra or numerical code) see [https://github.com/lukacsarpad/notes-and-solutions](my github repository).
